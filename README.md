# Physics-Calculator
A Physics Calculator -ui based- that is able to solve a lot of different types of variables if provided with the correct data
**How it works!**
the physics calculator uses a very simple Python Ui Algorithm to create a simple window with a drop down menu, this is then followed by the different types of variable required to be filled in to allow the equation to be solved. The calculator would for now would only work as a text based model with the correct asked for units. In future development i will integrate the UI model and will also enable units of any type that are allowed to be used.

The current Equations that are here are:
- Stress(also known as pressure): Force/Area
- Strain: New Length/ Original Lenght
- Young Moduls: Stress/Strain
- Work Done: Force * Displacement
- Work Done (for Spring's): (1/2) * Force * Change in X
- Elastic Strain Energy: (1/2) * Spring Constant * (Change in X)^2
- Hooke's Law: Spring Constant * Extension

The calculator will expand its library of equations above.
